## Description

This website allows users to choose their favorite dog breed (Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd, or Corgi) and view a short video and an image slideshow of that breed. It also allows a user to submit their name and email to join a mailing list. After joining, the user can access a dropdown menu of links to external dog resource websites.

## TODO

Website currently validates user input name and email, but doesn't actually sign them up for a mailing list. This could be added in the future.
